### Architecture and Technology

![wireframe](/app/assets/images/wireframe.png)


The game is built with the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for handling movement and platform logic,
- `Canvas` for rendering game map,
- `HTML DOM/CSS` for styling

The game follows OOP and will be broken down into few major scripts:

- `game.js` to handle map traversal,
- `player.js` to manipulate playerâ€™s state and movements,
- `level.js` to deal with different levels of the game and the architecture of the obstacle course,
- `platform.js` and `exit.js` to organise other features.
